<h3>Castaway</h3>
<p>Castaway is an excellent movie. Tom Hanks does an excellent job portraying the descent into madness due to isolation. I also love the character Wilson. Overall 10/10 Movie.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Phenomenal Film with a crazy plot twist at the end. The atmosphere in this movie is so mysterious and ominous - I love it!</p>
<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>This movie is awesome, and directed by Jordan Peele. Very captivating plot, that makes it more than just another horror movie. I highly recommend.</p>
